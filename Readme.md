# Create a router

This first route is what we often call the "root route" since the rest of our routes will render inside of it. It will serve as the root layout of the UI, we'll have nested layouts as we get farther along.

# Change path

If changed the path to "tests", then will need use "/tests", to reach the same page.ss

# Add contacts route

However, it's not inside of our root layout ðŸ˜
